# Contributing to the Circle Rust SDK

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`).
4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.
5.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub (`git push origin my-feature-branch`).
6.  **Open a pull request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Development Setup

To get started with development, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed. You can find instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust set up, you can build the project with:

```bash
cargo build
```

And run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Coding Style

Please follow the standard Rust coding style. You can use `rustfmt` to automatically format your code:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub and provide as much detail as possible, including:

-   A clear description of the bug.
-   Steps to reproduce the bug.
-   The expected behavior.
-   The actual behavior.
-   Your operating system and Rust version.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and make sure your contribution is in line with the project's goals.

Thank you for contributing!
